-	Install Docker Desktop
-	When prompted, install WSL. An acronym for Windows Subsystem for Linux, it allows Docker to run on your Windows system. Please note this will create a partition, but it is also easy to uninstall so do not fret.

Theory
What is Docker?
Docker is an open platform that enables developers to build, ship, and run applications within isolated environments called containers. It achieves this by providing a standardized way to package an application and all its dependencies (libraries, system tools, code, and runtime) into a single, self-contained unit.
